#Main dev path

1. File Parsing and Chunking
Objective: Split the input text file into fixed-size chunks.

Implementation:

Read the file sequentially in chunks of specified size (default 4KB).

Track the byte offset for each chunk to record its position in the original file.

2. SimHash Fingerprint Generation
Objective: Compute a SimHash for each chunk to group similar chunks.

Implementation:

Tokenization: Split chunk text into words using whitespace.

Hashing Tokens: Use FNV-1a 64-bit hash for each token.

Vector Aggregation: Create a 64-bit vector by aggregating token hashes.

Fingerprint: Generate the final SimHash by thresholding the aggregated vector.

3. In-Memory Index Construction
Objective: Map SimHash values to chunk offsets for fast retrieval.

Implementation:

Use a Go map[uint64][]int64 to store each SimHash and its corresponding chunk offsets.

Serialize the map along with metadata (filename, chunk size) using Go's encoding/gob.

4. Lookup Mechanism
Objective: Retrieve chunk positions based on SimHash.

Implementation:

Deserialize the index to rebuild the in-memory map.

Read the original file at recorded offsets to fetch the chunk content.

5. CLI Tool Structure
Commands:

Index: Processes the file and creates an index.

Lookup: Queries the index for a SimHash and retrieves chunk data.

6. Concurrency (Bonus)
Objective: Accelerate indexing using parallel processing.

Implementation:

Use worker goroutines to compute SimHashes concurrently.

Synchronize using channels to collect results and build the index.
